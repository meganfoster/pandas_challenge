City School Analysis

In evaluating the data analysis performed on the Py City School Data, it is evident Charter Schools have the best and highest Overall Passing percentages appearing in the Top 5 Spots out of 15.  On the other hand, District Schools have the worst Overall Passing percentages and appear in the Bottom 5 Spots.  This would indicate that a student has a 35% higher chance of passing both math and reading assessments if they attend a Charter School.  

Additionally, an increase in spending per student does not show an improvement in score and passing outcomes.  In fact, the opposite is true.  Schools where less than $585 is spent per student (the lowest range in our possible outcomes), have the highest score outcomes.  As spending per student increases, the outcomes decrease in all instances.
